# Malayalam Transliteration: English to Malayalam Script
This project provides a simple transliteration program for the Malayalam language. It converts words written in a Romanized form (English) to their corresponding Malayalam script.

## Features

*   **Transliteration:** Converts Romanized Malayalam words into their correct Malayalam script form.
*   **Database:** Uses a database of possible English typings of Malayalam words.
* **Learning**: The program tries to learn from user inputs and improve.


  
## How It Works

The program works by creating a database of possible English typings of Malayalam words. When you input a word, the program attempts to find a near match in the database. Using the learning algorithm it will try to adjust its database to get better and better.


## To Do

*   Improve tokenizing to better handle a wider variety of inputs.
*   Use a better method to remove noise from the input.
*   Improve the learning algorithm to learn more efficiently.
